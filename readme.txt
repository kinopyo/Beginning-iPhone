This is source code for Beginning iPhone 3 Development: Exploring the iPhone SDK by Dave Mark and Jeff LaMarche. All of the projects from the book are contained here. Each folder's name begins with a number that denotes the chapter the project was discussed in. Since several chapters had several version applications, each folder includes the name of the application as it was referred to in the book.

You may find slight differences at times between the code in the book and the code displayed here. As we find bugs or obvious optimizations, we will make changes to the source code, but those same changes won't be included in the book until the next printing. You will find comments describing the difference everywhere that we've made substantive changes. Minor changes will be identified in the addenda on the book's web page located at http://iphonedevbook.com.

This version of the code is intended for use with iPhone SDK 3.1.2. It was last updated on October 12, 2009.

Note: All projects have had their base SDK set to iPhone Simulator 3.1.2. If you have not yet updated to 3.1.2, you may have to change the SDK, as it may default to running on the device. If you want to run any of these programs on a device, you can follow the instructions in the iPhone SDK Portal at http://developer.apple.com/iphone/.
